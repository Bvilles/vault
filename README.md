# Vault: Bitcoin-Inspired DeFi Protocol

A minimalist, secure DeFi protocol built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. The protocol focuses on providing essential DeFi functionality while maintaining Bitcoin's principles of simplicity and security.

## Features

- **Secure Asset Vault**: Store and manage digital assets with Bitcoin-level security
- **Liquidity Pools**: Provide liquidity and earn fees from token swaps
- **Yield Farming**: Generate yield through protocol participation
- **Low Fee Structure**: Competitive 0.5% base fee for all operations
- **Transparent Logic**: All smart contract code is readable and verifiable

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts

The protocol consists of the following core components:

1. **Vault Contract**: Manages deposits, withdrawals, and access control
2. **Liquidity Pool**: Handles token pair pools and swap operations
3. **Yield Distribution**: Manages yield farming rewards and distribution

### Key Functions

- `deposit`: Deposit assets into the vault
- `withdraw`: Withdraw assets from the vault
- `add-liquidity`: Provide liquidity to token pairs
- `calculate-swap-output`: Calculate token swap outputs with fees
- `set-protocol-fee`: Admin function to adjust protocol fees

## Security Features

- Immutable contract logic
- Access control mechanisms
- Balance checks and validations
- Reentrancy protection
- Arithmetic overflow protection (built into Clarity)

## Getting Started
